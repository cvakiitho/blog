Welcome to a first post in a build log series, about a very first mechanical keyboard I'm building.

*Why this blog series even exists?*

I wanted to document how to build a handwired keyboard, because I myself, used several similar build logs, to get the motivation, and necessary guidance through the process of building such thing. I'm also 90% sure I will be building similar keyboard again in the future, and I'd like to have a place to get back to if needed.

## Series Parts:
- Motivation
- Ergonomic Keyboards
- Various Dactyls
- Tools + Shopping list
- 3D printing
- Soldering
- Wiring + Flashing

*Why I even ended up with such a weird design for keyboard?*

As a SW Engineer I write a lot of code, a lot of text, and spend a lot of time behind PC. Through the years, and various mild RSI problems, I gradually ditched mouse in favour of trackball, and keyboard shortcuts. Mostly [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) keybindings everywhere I can: 
- [Chrome - Vimium ](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb)
- [Safari - Vimmy](https://gggritso.com/vimmy.safariextension/)
- [VSCode - Vim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim)

After a bit I realized how much time I really spend with my fingers on a keyboard. so why not but a bit of effort in researching better options
