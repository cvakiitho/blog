Welcome to a first post in a build log series, about a very first mechanical keyboard I'm building.

Q: Why this blog series even exists?

A: I wanted to document how to build a handwired keyboard, because I myself, used several similar build logs, to get the motivation, and necessary guidance through the process of building such thing. I'm also 90% sure I will be building similar keyboard again in the future, and I'd like to have a place to get back to if needed.

## Series Parts:
- Ergonomic Keyboards
- Various Dactyls
- Tools + Shopping list
- 3D printing
- Soldering
- Wiring + Flashing

Why I even ended up with such a weird design for keyboard?
